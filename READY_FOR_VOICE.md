# 🎤 Ready for Voice Commands!

## ✅ System Status
Everything is cleaned up and ready for your voice input!

- **Database**: Clean and empty (0 notes, 0 reminders)
- **Webhook Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Web App**: Running on http://localhost:8000
- **Tunnel**: Active at https://neat-rabbits-go.loca.lt

## 🔧 ElevenLabs Agent Configuration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Update all 5 webhook tool URLs in your ElevenLabs agent to:
```
https://neat-rabbits-go.loca.lt/webhook
```

Make sure all these tools are configured with the new URL:
1. `add_note`
2. `add_reminder`
3. `get_notes`
4. `modify_note`
5. `delete_note`

## 🎯 Test Voice Commands

Try saying these commands to your ElevenLabs agent:

### Basic Commands
- "Add a note: Buy groceries"
- "Add a note about the client meeting tomorrow"
- "Create a reminder to call mom on Sunday at 2 PM"
- "Remind me to submit the report by Friday"

### Retrieval Commands
- "What notes do I have?"
- "Show me my reminders"
- "Read my notes"

### Management Commands
- "Delete the note about groceries"
- "Modify the client meeting note"

## 👀 Where to See Results

1. **Web Interface**: Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. **Auto-refresh**: Notes will appear automatically every 10 seconds
3. **Debug**: Check browser console (F12) for debug messages

## 🐛 Debugging

If voice commands don't work:
1. Check ElevenLabs agent webhook URLs are correct
2. Look at webhook server logs in terminal
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify tunnel URL is accessible
